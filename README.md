# Shop247 Frontend

This repository contains the frontend React app for the Shop247 e-commerce platform. The live site can be found [here](https://shop247-aut.netlify.app/). This project relies on a backend API to serve content to it, and by default will use the live Shop247 API. You can also clone the backend repo yourself from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/loganmartlew/shop247-backend).
